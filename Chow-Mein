<h3> What Is The Origin On Fried Chow Mein?</h3>
<li> Fried chow mein originated in China and was brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants, particularly those from the Taishanese region, during the mid-19th century. Initially a simple stir-fried noodle dish with vegetables and meat, it evolved in America into various styles, with some versions becoming Americanized with additions like thick gravy, while different regional adaptations, such as a more crispy or soft style, also emerged.</li>

<h3> Steps </h3>

  <div width="800"><li>1. Prepare the noodles </li>
    <li> Boil chow mein noodles until they are just tender, then drain and rinse them with cool water. Set the cooked noodles aside. Some recipes suggest tossing them with a little sesame or cooking oil to prevent them from sticking together</li>

<li> 2. Prepare the other ingredients</li>
<LI>Cook any protein, such as sliced chicken or beef, until it is mostly cooked through, then remove it from the wok.
Prepare your vegetables by cutting them into bite-sized pieces.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the ingredients for your sauce (like soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic, and ginger).</li> 

<li> 3. Cook the Chow Mein </li>
<li>Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over high heat.
Stir-fry aromatic ingredients like garlic and ginger for about 30 seconds, or until fragrant.
Add the prepared vegetables and stir-fry for a few minutes until they are tender-crisp.
Add the noodles to the wok and toss them with the vegetables.
Pour the prepared sauce over the noodles and stir-fry until everything is well-combined and heated through.
Add your cooked protein back to the wok and toss to combine.</li></div>

<h3> What Is Chow Mein?</h3>
<li>Chow mein is the English derivative of the word chau meing and comes from the Taishan dialect of Chinese. Chau means stir-fried and meing means noodles. The noodles are usually parboiled and then finished off in a hot wok, where they’re combined with aromatics, protein, and crunchy vegetables. It works beautifully as a stand alone dish or served family-style.</li>
